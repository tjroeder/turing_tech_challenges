# Millions of Numbers

## Instructions:
You are given three arrays of **equal** size. Each array has 1 million **RANDOM** integer values.

Assume that each array is already sorted in ascending order and that no individual array has any duplicate values.

Your goal is to write a method/function that will return an array of any/all values which are present in all three arrays.

## Bonus: 
Once youâ€™ve found a working solution, try to optimize to run in O(n) time and 1x space complexity.

## Small Scale Example Below:

### Ruby:
```
nums_1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
nums_2 = [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
nums_3 = [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]
find_matches(nums_1, nums_2, nums_3)
=> [2, 5]
```

### JavaScript:
```
nums1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
nums2 = [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
nums3 = [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]
findMatches(nums1, nums2, nums3)
=> [2, 5]
```
